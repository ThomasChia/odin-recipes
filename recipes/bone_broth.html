        </h2>
        <p>
            Bone broth is a very healthy and resourceful dish to use up any 
            leftover bones and vegetables. It is packed with nutrients and 
            delicious on a cold Winter day.

            Ingredients
        </h2>

        <ul>
            <li>aluminum foil</li>
            <li>1 leftover chicken carcass, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>6 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>Â½ tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Place chicken bones onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Place baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast bones for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently transfer bones from the baking sheet into a large and heavy stockpot. 
                Add onion and enough water to cover the bones by 2 inches. Add vinegar, salt, 
                and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and 
                simmer, partially covered, leaving enough space for steam to escape, for 4 
                to 5 hours. Check occasionally for froth or foam that develops on top of the 
                water, removing it with a large spoon.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and let cool. Strain broth through a fine mesh strainer 
                into a clean pot. Let cool completely. Store in the refrigerator and use within 
                5 days or freeze until ready to use.</li>
        </ol>
